# Fibonacci
Fibonacci is a sequence of numbers staring from 0 until an infinite number of additions of the N-1 and N-2. With N being the current value. For example we can look at the sequence which is 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 and so on. So the formula to actually get each value within the Fibonacci sequence N = Current value within the sequence being N - 1 + N -2 for example we could look at value 5 which is 3 so how to get 3 would be N - 1 which is 2 and N - 2 which is 1 so 2 + 1 = 3. The only rule within the sequence is the first N value has to be 0 and the second N value has to be 1.
